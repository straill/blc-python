INTRODUCTION

Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
the pitch.
{% endcomment %}
Want to learn how to use Python in metadata and other technical services work, but not sure where to start? In this workshop, we will explore several real-world applications of Python for working with library data, including modifying MARC records and wrangling spreadsheets. We'll focus on practical, basic concepts and techniques to provide a solid foundation for further exploration on your own. We'll cover:
<ul>
  <li>How to get started</li>
  <li>File input and output</li>
  <li>Working with spreadsheets and CSV files</li>
  <li>Using pymarc to work with MARC records</li>
  <li>Resources for learning more on your own</li>
 </ul>
The instructor will share several example scripts from her own work for participants to use as references and templates for their own Python experiments. Participants will be encouraged to code along during the workshop, but no previous coding experience is required.

  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
    In order to code along (optional, but recommended), participants have two options. Please decide which option you want to use and install any necessary software before the workshop begins.
    <ol>
      <li>Use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> online. Colab requires that you have a Google account in order to use it.</li>
      <li>Install software on your own computer. The simplest way to get almost everything you need is to install the open-source <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">Anaconda distribution.</a> Full instructions are below.</li>

https://pad.carpentries.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

Note we also have a CodiMD (the open-source version of HackMD)
available at https://codimd.carpentries.org

SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.
{% endcomment %}

{% elsif site.carpentry == "incubator" %}
This workshop is teaching a lesson in [The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/).
Please check [the lesson homepage]({{ site.incubator_lesson_site }}) for a list of lesson sections and estimated timings.
{% endif %}

{% comment %}
Edit/replace the text above if you want to include a schedule table.
See the contents of the _includes/custom-schedule.html file for an example of
how one of these schedule tables is constructed.
{% endcomment %}

{% if site.pilot %}
The lesson taught in this workshop is being piloted and a precise schedule is yet to be established. The workshop will include regular breaks. Please [contact the workshop organisers](#contact) if you would like more information about the planned schedule.

SETUP

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
and end easier to find.

This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.
