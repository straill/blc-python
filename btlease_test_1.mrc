Her two old friends, Sunny and Rachel, left ages ago for New York, where they've landed good jobs, handsome husbands, and unfairly glamorous lives (or at least so it appears to Geraldine). Sick of watching from the sidelines, Geraldine decides to force the universe to give her the big break she knows she deserves, and moves to New York City. After she arrives, though, and zigzags her way through the downtown art scene and rooftop party circuit, she discovers how hard it is to find her footing in a world of influencers and media darlings. Plus, the magazine where Sunny and Rachel work is on the brink of folding. Rachel is struggling to juggle her life as a writer, wife, and new mother--how is it that she was more confident and successful at twenty-five than in her mid-thirties? And Sunny's life as a popular West Village tastemaker is not nearly as charmed as it seemed to Geraldine from Toronto. Perhaps worst of all, why are Sunny and Rachel--who've always been suspicious of each other--suddenly hanging out without Geraldine?  Hilarious and fiercely observed, How Could She is a novel of female friendship, an insider's look into the cutthroat world of New York media--from print to podcasting--and a witty exploration of the ways we can and cannot escape our pasts. In Geraldine, Sunny, and Rachel, Mechling exposes how women can pragmatically manipulate one another in life and in love, and how the glamour, energy, and hope of New York City doesn't deliver for everyone, but sometimes, in the most unexpected and delightful moments, embraces those who have just the right amount of hope and delusion"--cProvided by publisher. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xSocial life and customsvFiction. 7aFICTION / Contemporary Women.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Satire.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Literary.2bisacsh08iOnline version:aMechling, Lauren.tHow could shed[New York] : Viking, [2019]z9780525559399w(DLC)  2018052914  a0627201900517nam a22001935i 4500008004100000020002800041020002500069035002500094040002900119069001300148100001900161245002400180264002300204300001400227336002100241337002500262338002300287935001300310190620s2019    xx            000 1 eng d  a9780062912954 :c$26.99  a006291295X :c$26.99  a(NjBwBT)bk0023777820  aNjBwBTbengcNjBwBTerda  a0922355810aJames, Eloisa.10aSay No to the Duke. 1bAvon Books,c2019.  a276 pages  atext2rdacontent  aunmediated2rdamedia  avolume2rdacarrier  a0627201901438cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000800410001701000170005802000280007502000250010303500250012804000380015304200140019105000240020506900130022908200140024210000310025624500460028726400350033330000230036833600260039133700280041733800270044552001860047252100260065865000300068465000270071465000220074165000300076365000270079365000310082065000390085165000240089077601250091493500130103920190619121913.0181025s2019    nyu    d      000 1 eng    a  2018045398  a9781681198095 :c$18.99  a1681198096 :c$18.99  a(NjBwBT)\\2018045398  aDLCbengerdacDLCdGCmBTdNjBwBT  apccalcac00aPZ7.K3052bCal 2019  a0922355800a[Fic]2231 aKemmerer, Brigid,eauthor.10aCall it what you want /cBrigid Kemmerer. 1aNew York :bBloomsbury,c2019.  a374 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aOnce-popular Rob and overachiever Maegan, both dealing with serious family issues, quickly form a bond that is threatened when Rob confides plans to repair damage his father caused.2 a10-12bBaker & Taylor 1aFamily problemsvFiction. 1aHigh schoolsvFiction. 1aSchoolsvFiction. 1aConduct of lifevFiction. 1aEmbezzlementvFiction. 1aFathers and sonsvFiction. 1aPeople with disabilitiesvFiction. 1aPregnancyvFiction.08iOnline version:aKemmerer, Brigid.tCall it what you wantdNew York : Bloomsbury, 2019z9781681198118w(DLC)  2018051477  a0627201900541nam a22001935i 4500008004100000020002800041020002500069035002500094040002900119069001300148100002100161245003500182264003400217300001400251336002100265337002500286338002300311935001300334190620s2019    xx     j      000 1 eng d  a9780241401132 :c$12.99  a0241401135 :c$12.99  a(NjBwBT)bk0024433922  aNjBwBTbengcNjBwBTerda  a0922355810aPotter, Beatrix.10aPeter Rabbit 5-Minute Stories. 1bFrederick Warne & Co.,c2019.  a177 pages  atext2rdacontent  aunmediated2rdamedia  avolume2rdacarrier  a0627201902625pam a2200373 i 450000500170000000800410001701000170005802000280007502000250010303500250012804000310015304200080018405000280019206900130022008200150023308400340024810000240028224500420030626400340034830000230038233600260040533700280043133800270045952014100048665000220189665000310191865100220194965100460197165500290201765000330204665000330207977601260211293500130223820190613122329.0181116s2019    nyu           000 1 eng    a  2018053742  a9781524741969 :c$28.00  a1524741965 :c$28.00  a(NjBwBT)\\2018053742  aDLCbengerdacDLCdNjBwBT  apcc00aPS3618.O89265bG66 2019  a0922355800a813/.6223  aFIC030000aFIC0190002bisacsh1 aRoy, Lori,eauthor.10aGone too long :ba novel /cLori Roy. 1a[New York] :bDutton,c[2019]  a337 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Two-time Edgar Award-winning author Lori Roy entangles readers in a heart-pounding tale of two women battling for survival against a century's worth of hate.  On the day a black truck rattles past her house and a Klan flyer lands in her front yard, ten-year-old Beth disappears from her Simmonsville, Georgia, home. Armed with skills honed while caring for an alcoholic mother, she must battle to survive the days and months ahead.  Seven years later, Imogene Coulter is burying her father--a Klan leader she has spent her life distancing herself from--and trying to escape the memories his funeral evokes. But Imogene is forced to confront secrets long held by Simmonsville and her own family when, while clearing out her father's apparent hideout on the day of his funeral, she finds a child. Young and alive, in an abandoned basement, and behind a door that only locks from the outside.  As Imogene begins to uncover the truth of what happened to young Beth all those years ago, her father's heir apparent to the Klan's leadership threatens her and her family. Driven by a love that extends beyond the ties of blood, Imogene struggles to save a girl she never knew but will now be bound to forever, and to save herself and those dearest to her. Tightly coiled and chilling,Gone Too Long ensnares, twists, and exposes the high price we are willing to pay for the ones we love"--cProvided by publisher. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aMissing childrenvFiction. 0aGeorgiavFiction. 0aSouthern StatesxRace relationsvFiction. 7aSuspense fiction.2gsafd 7aFICTION / Suspense.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Literary.2bisacsh08iOnline version:aRoy, Lori.tGone too longbFirst edition.d[New York] : Dutton, [2019]z9781524741976w(DLC)  2018056027  a06272019
